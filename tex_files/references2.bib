@article{Aragon.2016,
 abstract = {We examine how modern, polluting industries can affect agricultural productivity. The focus is on large-scale gold mining in Ghana, which is capital-intensive, releases environmental pollutants and is located near agricultural areas. Guided by a consumer--producer household framework, we estimate an agricultural production function and find that farmers located near mines experienced a relative reduction in total factor productivity of almost 40{\%} between 1997 and 2005. We examine alternative mechanisms and find that pollution is the most plausible explanation for our results. This article highlights an important externality through which industries can affect living conditions in rural areas.},

Reducing pollution in these areas to achieve the standard would, we estimate, increase life expectancy for these Indians by 3.2 years on average for a total of 2.1 billion life years.

@article{Duflo.2013,
 abstract = {In many regulated markets, private, third-party auditors are chosen and paid by the firms that they audit, potentially creating a conflict of interest. This article reports on a two-year field experiment in the Indian state of Gujarat that sought to curb such a conflict by altering the market structure for environmental audits of industrial plants to incentivize accurate reporting. There are three main results. First, the status quo system was largely corrupted, with auditors systematically reporting plant emissions just below the standard, although true emissions were typically higher. Second, the treatment caused auditors to report more truthfully and very significantly lowered the fraction of plants that were falsely reported as compliant with pollution standards. Third, treatment plants, in turn, reduced their pollution emissions. The results suggest reformed incentives for third-party auditors can improve their reporting and make regulation more effective.

@article{Currie.2015,
 abstract = {Regulatory oversight of toxic emissions from industrial plants and

understanding about these emissions' impacts are in their infancy.

Applying a research design based on the openings and closings of

1,600 industrial plants to rich data on housing markets and infant

health, we find that: toxic air emissions affect air quality only within

1 mile of the plant; plant openings lead to 11 percent declines in

housing values within 0.5 mile or a loss of about 4.25 million

for these households; and a plant's operation is associated with

a roughly 3 percent increase in the probability of low birthweight

within 1 mile. (JEL I12, L60, Q52, Q53, Q58, R23, R31)},
